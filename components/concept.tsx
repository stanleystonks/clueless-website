          How It Started

            Ashley was like many of us, juggling the demands of a hectic life
            and chasing dreams that seemed forever out of reach. She felt like
            she was coasting through each day, guided more by inertia than
            intention. It was a life full of busyness but lacking the sense of
            purpose she craved.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Time slipped through her fingers like sand, and she wondered if her
            aspirations were destined to remain just that—dreams, forever out of
            reach. Her relationships were strained by her constant busyness, and
            self-care had become an afterthought.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            She felt like a passenger in her own life, lost in the commotion.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            But deep within her, Ashley knew there was more. She knew she had
            the potential for greatness, for a life filled with meaning and
            fulfillment. She yearned for mindfulness, self-discovery, and a
            sense of control.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Her journey mirrored the struggles many face—a journey of
            uncertainty, frustration, and an unrelenting desire for change.
            Little did she know that her story was about to take an
            extraordinary turn.

            Many people can relate to Ashley's experiences, for it's entirely
            normal and human to go through periods of feeling adrift in the
            complexities of life. It's a shared experience we all encounter at
            some point. The key is recognizing when one has arrived at this
            crossroads of feeling 'clueless' about their own existence.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>When that moment arrives, it's a signal that action is needed.</p>

        <div className="w-4/5 pt-10 text-center lg:w-3/5">
          <p>
            There's no magic fix for that 'clueless' feeling, but remember,
            you're not stuck there forever.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are ways to move beyond that feeling of being lost in life.
